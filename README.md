Two different projects

weather - a simple single-page app using a templating engine I wrote as a zepto extension.

INS - infinite swapping studies for determine low temperature properties of non-ergodic systems.  
      - tested on simple hydrogen system
      - applied to adiabatic quantum annealing and classic covering problems
  Conclusion:  infinite swapping is definitely better for finding thermal properies non-ergodic systems, 
               but not well suited for finding actual ground state.  Plain parallel tempering is probably more efficient.
