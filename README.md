-------

*  simple single-page app using a framework and templating engine I wrote as a zepto extension
*  using open weather map api's
*  need simple groovy server included since the framework uses ajax for template loads

*  infinite swapping studies for determine low temperature properties of non-ergodic systems
*  tested on simple hydrogen system
*  applied to adiabatic quantum annealing and classic covering problems

**Conclusion**:  Infinite swapping is definitely better for finding thermal properies non-ergodic systems, 
               but not well suited for finding actual ground state.  Plain parallel tempering is probably more efficient.
