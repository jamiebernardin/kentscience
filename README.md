Some research hacking...mostly science projects in numerical computing

INS
---

*  infinite swapping studies for determine low temperature properties of non-ergodic systems
*  tested on simple hydrogen system
*  applied to adiabatic quantum annealing and classic covering problems

**Conclusion**:  Infinite swapping is definitely better for finding thermal properies non-ergodic systems, 
               but not well suited for finding actual ground state.  Plain parallel tempering is probably more efficient.

weather
-------

*  single-page app using my own JavaScript framework and templating engine I wrote as a zepto extension
*  open weather map api's
*  simple groovy server included since my framework requires ajax for template loads
